<img width="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gorillalogic/nestjs-graphql-nats-stack/assets/42254348/bd3650dc-8dd4-412b-a5c5-9a6cd42671a9">

- Simple ToDo App, allows to signup, signin, CRUD tasks and mark as done.
- Using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) stack with GraphQL, NATS with a microservice arquitecture.
- MariaDB database on AWS RDS.
- User Management using AWS Cognito.
- Frontend app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), React, Redux, Apollo Client. Deployed statically on S3 and cached using Cloudfront.

## File structure

- /frontend contains the files related to the Vite React app.
- /terraform contains the infrastructure related files.
- /apps contain the microservice apps from NestJS.

## Infrastructure

### Setup

- Install Terraform v1.4.6
- Install and configure aws cli
- Run `terraform plan` to see potential changes and `terraform apply` to create the stack.
- Optionally, install [infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost) for cost estimates.
- Create terraform.tfvars in the /terraform dir, check variables.tf to see which vars are required.
- This projects relies on AWS Fargate and ECR for storing docker images, so if it is desired to update the task definitions after a docker image update, run:
  ```bash
  terraform apply -replace="aws_ecs_task_definition.main"
  ```
  
## Backend

### Setup
- Developed and tested on Node v18
- Install [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
- `brew install nats-streaming-server`
- Install a mysql 8 compatible db locally. Or containerized version.
- Create .env file using .env.example template, in the root dir.

### To publish an image
- An output of the terraform stack is the url of the ECR repository. To publish a new version:
```bash
docker build . --tag <ecr-repo-url>/<image-name>
docker push <ecr-repo-url>/<image-name>
```
- If docker is not authenticated with AWS:
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 
```

## Frontend

### Setup
- Create .env.local and .env.production files, follow .env.example to see which env vars are expected.
- To build run `npm run build` or `npm run build --mode=production`.
- To deploy, if the infrastructure is already deployed and the aws cli is ready to use:
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync ./dist s3://<bucket-name>
  ```
  
## Authentication

- PKCE Authentication is used with Cognito, the flow is like this:
  - React App attemps to read token stored in the Redux store.
  - When token is found
    - Attach as Bearer token to any graphql requests until a expired or invalid code is returned.
    - Graphql Gateway verifies jwt token using Cognito APIs. Cognito randomized username is then used as identity id in the microservices.
  - When token is not found.
    - Redirects to cognito hosted page for authentication so the user can sign in or sign up. Code challenge/verifier pair is generated and challenge is passed as param.
    - Cognito Auth page will redirect to the origin passing a single use token.
    - React App retrieves Cognito token endpoint passing the single use token and the code verifier is passed as param.
    - If successful, Cognito responds with jwt tokens.
    - React App saves jwt tokens in redux store which are attached to future graphql requests.
  
## Authorization
- RBAC, but for now any user is hardcoded with the `user` role. Manual testing was done to verify a potential admin role, but no feature requires this.

## Backend Database
- MariaDB for production (AWS RDS), mysql 8 used locally.
- Migrations and ORM is done using [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io)

## Orchestration
- Production containers run on AWS ECS Fargate, tasks and services are described in [fargate.tf](terraform/fargate.tf)

## Networking and Permissions
- Public/Private subnets on a non-default VPC in AWS. NAT Gateway provisioned by AWS that should be turned off when not in usage to avoid costs (~$30/mo). 
- RDS public access blocked.
- S3 for static files public access is not blocked for now, it should be and add an origin policy to ensure only cloudfront has read access to it. *Pending*
- Review [network.tf](terraform/network.tf), [vpc.tf](terraform/vpc.tf), [subnets.tf](terraform/subnets.tf), [security_groups](terraform/security_groups.tf), [route53](terraform/route53.tf), [iam.tf](terraform/iam.tf) and others.

## Where to test
- Write me a DM for access to a hosted app or use a domain of your choice.
